collectd-pkgbuild
=================

This builds a recent version of collectd for CentOS/RHEL 6 and packages it as RPM. 
For CentOS/RHEL 7 the EPEL repository already carries v5.4.1 of collectd, only without
the Oracle plugin. So this build script is useful if you need that plugin.

Collectd, https://collectd.org/, grabs all kinds of metrics and saves them or sends them on.

We use it to collect low level system metrics: cpu, memory, network, disk. Think sar.  
We send it to graphite so we can create dashboards, have nagios alerts, etc.

We also collect Oracle DBMS metrics to get a better view on what it is doing (wrong).  
More info at: https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Oracle

EPEL 6 already has collectd packages but they didnÂ´t work for us because:
- It's an ancient version without write_graphite and many other cool new features.
- The Oracle plugin is not included.


Building
--------

The build script needs the following before it will work.
- vagrant
- a CentOS vagrant box
- Oracle RPMS
- collectd source RPM

1. Vagrant

  I run vagrant on Ubuntu but other Linux or OS-X should work fine.  
  Get an recent version at http://vagrantup.com

2. CentOS vagrant box

  The `vagrant up` should get the box, otherwise install it by hand:  
  I use the one from Chef bento project https://github.com/opscode/bento  
  CentOS box:
  `vagrant box add chef/centos-6.5 http://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/virtualbox/opscode_centos-6.5_chef-provisionerless.box`

3. Download ora instant client and devel RPMs

  The packages are proprietary and behind a login wall.

  You can find the packages at:
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html

  You'll need a OTN logon which you probably have if you have to run Oracle software.

  Grab the oracle-instantclient -basic(lite) and -devel RPMs and place them in the same folder as where the Vagrantfile sits.

4.a CentOS 6:  
  Get the fedora source RPM for collectd

  This is kept up to date but for the latest version of fedora and not EL of course.  
  https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/collectd  
  I used this one:  
  `curl -O http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/collectd/5.4.1/2.fc21/src/collectd-5.4.1-2.fc21.src.rpm`

4.b CentOS 7:  
  Source should be installed as part of the next step.  

5. Go, go, go build

    `vagrant up centos6`  
    OR  
    `vagrant up centos7`  

  If all goes well it will:
  - set up the centos box
  - get additional packages the collectd build depends on
  - rpmbuild collectd
  - copy the resulting RPMs in ./rpms/ directory

  To clean up:  
    `vagrant destroy centos6`  `vagrant destroy centos7`  

6. Use the RPMs

  Install them directly or put them in your local yum repo and let your configuration management tooling do the lifting.


Oracle plugin configuration
---------------------------

1. Add a monitor user to oracle

  `<example sql statement here>`

2. Add environment variables to collectd startup

  in /etc/default/collectd:
```
# changes the paths to your local settings
export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/1120
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/1120/lib
export TNS_ADMIN=/opt/oracle/tnsadmin
```    
3. Create a /etc/collectd.d/oracle.conf

  Docs at https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Oracle  
  
  See [collectd-oracle.conf](collectd-oracle.conf) for some basic oracle metrics.
